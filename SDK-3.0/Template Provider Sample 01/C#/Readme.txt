Template Provider Sample 01
===========================
     This sample creates a template for a provider that hooks into the Windows PowerShell
     namespaces. It contains all possible provider overrides and interfaces. A provider developer
     can copy this file, change the name of the file, delete those interfaces and methods the 
     provider doesn't need to implement or override, and use the remaining code as a template
     to create a fully functional provider.
