Script Line Profiler Sample
===========================
     This sample shows how to create a script line profiler using the new Windows PowerShell 3.0
     AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) support. The sample defines the InstrumentAst class (derived from
     the ICustomAstVisitor interface) that builds an AST object. The AST object inserts a Profile
     object callback that measures the execution time of each script statement. The profiler can
     be run on script files using the provided Measure-Script cmdlet.
